The current GCC in the ubuntu repository doesnâ€™t support the C++14 standard. To use the C++14 install the GCC has to be updated manually. It can be found in the Ubuntu Toolchain PPA. After this, the C++ compiler can be updated. The following commands show how to add the repository and install the compiler:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++-4.9

After the installation, the compiler can be used by this command:
g++-4.9
